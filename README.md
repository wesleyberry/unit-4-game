# unit-4-game

What the project does:
    Jazzy Gem is a game. It is built with html, CSS, and javascript or Jquery.
    Each div that includes an image of a gem is tied to a click event. This click event uses a function that randomly
    generates a number and sends it to a specific class/id to be added to the user's score.
    The goal of the game is to amount your (the user) points equal to that of the target score.
    If your score surpasses the target score, you lose, and new numbers will be generated for the on-click events and 
    the target score.
    Wins and losses are counted and displayed on screen.

Why the project is useful
    The project is intended to showcase the usefulness and application of on-click events, and how to use them with functions,
    "grabbing" values from an element, etc...

How users can get started with the project
    Start by clicking on the images of gems. There are four of them, and each will add a random random to your score. These
    values reset after every loss or win.
